 * Open for public usage
 * 
 * The objective of this file is to 
 * write out all the code necessary for the night light
 * object, which will be directly referenced by the smart
 * home object. This logic will be critical
 * 
 * Functionality can be enabled in the "Configuration.h" file
 * Should debugging be needed, disable all other features and simply
 * enable the "DEBUG" variable. This will output appropriate unit testing values
